		<b><p>The James Webb Space Telescope</b>
		
		(sometimes called JWST or Webb) is an orbiting infrared observatory that will complement and extend
		the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope, with longer wavelength coverage and greatly improved sensitivity. The longer wavelengths 
		enable Webb to look much closer to the beginning of time and to hunt for the unobserved formation of the first galaxies, as well as to look 
		inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today.
		</p>
		<p>jwst space telescope specifically designed to conduct infrared astronomy. Its high-resolution and high-sensitivity
		 instruments allow it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This enables investigations across many fields of astronomy and 
		cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.

		<p> The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led Webb's design and development and partnered with two main agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Maryland managed telescope development, while the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore
			on the Homewood Campus of Johns Hopkins University currently operates Webb. The primary contractor for the project was Northrop Grumman.
			The Webb was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first Webb image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022.</p>
		
			<img style="height 200 px;" src= images/web2.jpg />
		<p>Webb's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives Webb a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about six times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet and visible (0.1 to 0.8 μm), and near infrared (0.8–2.5 μm)[14] spectra, Webb observes a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6–28.3 μm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (−223 °C; −370 °F), so that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun–Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.</p>
			Initial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon by the media, scientists, and engineers. In July 2023, astronomers reported that the first year of James Webb Space Telescope operations was a considerable success.
		
		<p>The man whose name NASA has chosen to bestow upon the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope is most commonly linked to the Apollo moon 
			program, not to science, Yet, many believe that <b>James E. Webb</b>,who ran the fledgling space agency from February 1961 to October 1968,
			did more for science than perhaps any other government official and that it is only fitting that the Next Generation Space Telescope would be named after him.

		<h4 class= "purple">stephan's quintet galaxies</h4>    
		<p>NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory data harmonizes with Webb’s infrared information in this image of the four galaxies within Stephan’s Quintet. (A fifth galaxy, on the left, is photo-bombing the view.) The new Webb image reveals brand-new details of the results of these four galaxies interacting, including dramatic gas tails and star formation. As one of the galaxies zooms through the others at speeds of around two million miles per hour, it generates a shock wave that heats gas to tens of millions of degrees. Chandra showcases this effect in light blue. Red, green, and blue colors in the image include infrared data not only from Webb, but from NASA’s now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope.</p>
		
			<img src= images/gl2.jpg />
		<h4 class= "purple">pillars of creation</h4>
		<p>Located in a small region within the vast Eagle Nebula, 6,500 light years away, the Pillars of Creation look even more awe-inspiring through Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam).

			Semi-transparent gas and dust provide a nursery for new stars to be born, which are apparent as ruby red drops, often trimmed with eight diffraction spikes. Some brightly shining areas denote great masses within the pillars that are collapsing under their own gravity and heating up. The wavy lines along the edges of the pillars are ejections of nascent star matter, whose supersonic jets collide with dense clouds of gas and dust. Sometimes the reaction causes bow shocks, forming patterns of waves as a boat does in water. The Pillars are only a few hundred thousand years old, and will continue forming for millions of years.

			No distant galaxies are visible, because a translucent layer of hydrogen atoms, molecules, and solid dust particles blankets the view. The stars in this portion of the nebula light up dust and further obscures the deeper universe.

			Webb’s near-infrared cameras will help researchers get a better understanding of millions of years of star formation.</p>

		<h4 class= "purple">cartwheel galaxy</h4>
		<p>Here is another instance of one of Webb’s first images being married to another telescope’s data to birth a richer picture. In this case, data from Webb and NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory together depict the Cartwheel galaxy. Its whimsical shape comes from a collision with a smaller galaxy, which is not shown in this image. When this smaller galaxy drove through the Cartwheel, the energetic combination set off star formation, which appears predominantly on an outer ring. X-rays shown in blue and purple represent superheated gas, individual exploded stars, and neutron stars and black holes yanking at companion stars. At the same time, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue comes from Webb’s infrared view of the Cartwheel galaxy, plus two smaller companion galaxies. Farther away are a host of other galaxies in multicolor.</p>

		<h4 class= "purple">Jupiter From 3 Filters</h4>
		<p>Jupiter is a world of extremes, with mammoth storms, superfast winds and unbelievably cold temperatures. Webb is capturing the stunning details of our Solar System’s largest planet with NIRCam’s three specialized infrared filters.

			The longest wavelengths appear more red, and the shortest wavelengths look blue. Amateur artist and astronomer Judy Schmidt translated the Webb data into images. This picture is a composite from all the filters. The Great Red Spot, Jupiter’s hallmark storm that’s larger than Earth, looks appears white here, because, like the clouds in the picture, it is high-altitude and reflects a lot of sunlight.

			You can see auroras stretching to high altitudes above the northern and southern poles. These are visible thanks to a redder filter.</p>

		<h4 class= "purple">Galaxy IC 5332</h4>
		<p>If you want to see the “bones” of a galaxy, look no further. It’s not time for Halloween yet, but get in the mood with this image of spiral galaxy IC 5332, revealed in its stark, sharp glory through MIRI, Webb’s mid-infrared instrument. Its gaze in the 5- to 28-nanometer wavelength range seems to show gray cobwebs in the shape of a spiral, according to the Webb Flickr page. These delicate threads are gases swirled throughout the galaxy.

			Usually dust obscures these gas lanes, but a mid-infrared probe penetrates right through these particles, which are usually composed of either silicates or metals, and left by cooling or dead stars. This galaxy is over 29 million light years away, and it’s about 66,000 light years across, making it a bit larger than the Milky Way.

			Sight in the mid-infrared range is possible only because MIRI can be cooled to near absolute zero, preventing the infrared radiation of the instrumentation itself from interfering with its readings.</p>
			<img src= images/titan.jpg />
		<h4 class= "purple">Titan, Saturn’s Largest Moon</h4>
		<p>Titan has a nitrogen-rich atmosphere and rivers, lakes, and seas of hydrocarbons such as ethane and methane. This latter feature makes it unique in the solar system as the only other planetary body besides Earth to have these liquid environments.

			Because it has dense clouds, we cannot see what lies beneath Titan’s atmosphere in visible light. Webb’s infrared vision has verified our hypothesis that Titan has a cloud-filled summer in its northern hemisphere. It also has bright and dark areas on its surface.

			The Keck Observatory also recently observed Titan’s clouds and confirmed that the moon has seasonal weather, though scientific conclusions have not yet been peer reviewed, according to the Webb images site. NASA is planning to a 32-month mission to Titan with Dragonfly, which will launch in 2027 and observe the moon’s environment up close.</p>

		<h4 class= "purple">Fiery Hourglass Protostar</h4>
		<p>Here is the light of a star still in formation, spreading out in a shape reminiscent of an hourglass. Before Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) cast its gaze on it, this protostar was concealed within the dark cloud L1527 in the Taurus star-forming region. Astrophysicists hope to gain insight into the beginnings of a new star by analyzing data from such infrared sights. The actual young star is still hidden from view, inside the “neck” of the hourglass, an edge-on protoplanetary disk line across the middle of the hourglass neck. But the star’s light unfurls on either side of the line.</p>
			<img src= images/nep.jpg />
		<h4 class= "purple">Neptune</h4>
		<p>Did you know that Neptune has faint rings? Humanity caught its first glimpse of the rings during the Voyager 2 spacecraft flyby in 1989. Both Voyager 2 and the Hubble Telescope collected our most iconic views of Neptune in visible light in breathtaking shades of blue.

			But Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) captured a view of the ice giant and its rings like never before (in wavelengths from 0.6 to 5 microns). Webb’s camera also reveals faint dust bands around Neptune.

			The planet doesn’t appear blue to Webb. That’s because its methane-rich composition absorbs infrared wavelengths, so it appears darker overall. High-altitude methane-ice clouds do pop out, lighter and brighter, because they reflect sunlight.

			Neptune is 30 times more distant from the sun than Earth is. It’s so dim that if you were to land there in the middle of the day, you’d assume it was actually twilight.</p>

		<h4 class= "purple"</h4> The Phantom Galaxy</h4>
		<p>Derived from Webb data for the PHANGS (Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS) project, this stunner is M74, or NGC628, a spiral galaxy 32 million light years away. Webb’s Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) captured the raw data, and amateur astronomer and artist Judy Schmidt worked the data into the intricate dust lanes that grace the spiral arms in the image. The project focuses on galaxies that are apparently “face-on” from our view on Earth, and one of its main goals is to solve the mystery of star formation.

			Schmidt, also found online under the pseudonym “Geckzilla,” has been reworking the colors in images from large telescopes, including Hubble and Webb. Her work makes the faraway objects of deep space appear both vibrantly alive and mysterious.</p>
			<img src= images/gl9.jpg />
		<h4 class= "purple">Carina Nebula</h4>
		<p>What looks much like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening is actually the edge of a nearby, young, star-forming region NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula.

			Captured in infrared light by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, this image reveals previously obscured areas of star birth.

			Called the Cosmic Cliffs, the region is actually the edge of a gigantic, gaseous cavity within NGC 3324, roughly 7,600 light years away. The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image.

			The high-energy radiation from these stars is sculpting the nebula’s wall by slowly eroding it away. NIRCam—with its crisp resolution and unparalleled sensitivity—unveils hundreds of previously hidden stars, and even numerous background galaxies.
